 * Day four
 *what is JVM?
 * it is Java virtual machine that allows your computer: mac book or windows to execute java programming
 *
 *         System.out.println("Hello, JVM"); -> how can I print out Hello,JVM
 *         first step: you need java compiler, Java compiler will compile your code to bytecode -> will create .class file
 *
 *         second step. bytecode will be loaded into JVM by class loader
 *         and execution engine will execute bytecode
 *         runtime data area: provide a space to store bytecode, objects, parameter, local variables, return value
 *
 *
 * heap vs stack
